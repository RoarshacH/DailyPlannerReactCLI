## :star2: About the Project
  These days everyone is busy and tackling multiple tasks daily can be cumbersome. All the available planners are designed for widespread use, not specific use cases. Students who are attending their higher studies like college and university students have busy schedules. They sometimes tackle work and studies and other responsibilities daily and sometimes they forget about deadlines for some assignment or task they have planned to do. 
Having a convenient way to create a schedule for the day/week and adding all the upcoming deadlines and deciding if you have completed the required work or not can be beneficial for all the students attending their higher studies.
